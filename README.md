## Short Description
This game is a puzzle-oriented platformer that is structured in the form of a metroidvania. Character controls are WASD as well as Spacebar.

## Synopsis
This game is created with intention to draw attention to marine pollution and its impact on aquatic habitat. Specifically, we wanted this to be about the pollution in Bosphorus, which goes through our home Istanbul. 

Our character is a lost fish seeking the way home but there are obstacles in the way so the character needs to unlock transformations to transform into different species cohabitating the straits, to be able to use their abilities for overcoming various challenges blocking the path.
The transformations we have implemented are the Sea Turtle, Shark and Hamsi (European Anchovy) which all provide different benefits such as extra protection, ramming speed and extra speed, respectively. 

For the scope of Enhancer Hackathon, we have implemented a single scene consisting of seven sublevels that provide the players with different challenges.
